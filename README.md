- 👋 Hi, I’m @srknkcn
- 👀 I’m interested in horizontally in all technological processes. Like Kubernetes, a popular SPA framework, Backend optimizations, CI/CD, Linux open source alternatives, Endpoint Security for Enterprises, System Administration.
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the ability to provision and support your computing infrastructure using code instead of manual processes and settings. I like living with the IAC structure, which provides the opportunity for KnowHow transfer and which I think is the most robust system management.
- 🌱 I am trying with pleasure to become a much better DevOps career.
- 💞️ I want to work more actively on Kubernetes, Linux, CI/CD, .Net Core, SPA Frameworks technologies.
- 📫 You can reach me from my linkedin account
